# Social-Analytics-Driven-Health-Insights
In this project, we leveraged social media data gathered from Reddit for the purpose of tracking the prevalence of public interests and understanding public reaction towards identifying high priority conditions and/or disease states. For this project we Web Scraped the data from reddit by creating our own API using Flask which internally used Pushshift API. We did a high level Text Preprocessing using NLTK library, performed exploratory data analysis by creating a Time-Series Graph with Regression Analysis, Wordcloud, interactive Knowledge Graph for relational Taxonomy, performed Topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Sentiment Analytics using VADER, K-Means Clustering on Sentiment subjectivity and polarity. Thereafter created a Web Application using Streamlit and deployed it to AWS Lamda. This applivation provide potential public health application for early detection of diseases and means of information distribution for proactive response.
